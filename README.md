# Queue

Creates a queue object with the specified concurrency. Tasks added to the queue are processed in parallel (up to the concurrency limit). If all workers are in progress, the task is queued until one becomes available. Once a worker completes a task, that task's callback is called.

## Example

```javascript
// create a queue object with concurrency 2
var q = Queue(function(task, callback) {
    console.log('hello ' + task.name);
    callback();
}, 2);

// assign a callback
q.drain = function() {
    console.log('all items have been processed');
};

// add some items to the queue
q.push({name: 'foo'}, function(err) {
    console.log('finished processing foo');
});
q.push({name: 'bar'}, function (err) {
    console.log('finished processing bar');
});

// add some items to the queue (batch-wise)
q.push([{name: 'baz'},{name: 'bay'},{name: 'bax'}], function(err) {
    console.log('finished processing item');
});

// add some items to the front of the queue
q.unshift({name: 'bar'}, function (err) {
    console.log('finished processing bar');
});
```
